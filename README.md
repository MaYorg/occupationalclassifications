occupationalclassifications
===========================

Repository of historical and contemporary occupational classifications, e.g. ISCO'08, ISEI

### The why
All around the world people work, mainly to earn a living. What we do for a living tells a lot about our position in society. Who we talk to, who eat with, and even with whom we date. To study these relationships various schemes or classification have been designed to order the universe of occupations. Some classifications are merely that: categories of occupations for example based on type of industry. Others include some some additional component such as prestige, income or power. The first reason for having this site is to gather all of these schemes and make them available in one place. The other reason is to provide tools that help using these schemes, such as cross-overs between the schemes.

### The how
Basically, I just intend to provide links to schemes that are still available (e.g. ISCO2008), but also to digitize some of the older schemes, like those from censuses. The other component would be to provide an overview of tools that help one to work with these classifications, e.g. software that helps to code ones raw occupations into a particular scheme.

### The what
Any occupation based classication is welcome at this site. If you are still missing a classification or if you know of a tool still missing, please file this is as an issue.
